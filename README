This is an alternative emacs plugin, uses company-mode:
	http://nschum.de/src/emacs/company-mode

Here's how I use it in my .emacs:

(require 'company)                     ; load company mode
(require 'company-go)                  ; load company mode go backend and hook it up
(setq company-tooltip-limit 20)        ; bigger popup window
(setq company-minimum-prefix-length 0) ; autocomplete right after '.'
(setq company-idle-delay .3)           ; shorter delay before autocompletion popup
(setq company-echo-delay 0)            ; removes annoying blinking

One thing to note here is 'company-backends'. By default company mode loads
every backend it has and it takes a huge amount of time to do so. I don't like
when my emacs takes more than 1 second to load, therefore I use a local variable
in company-go.el which contains only one backend (that is company-go
backend). Therefore if you want to use more company mode backends together with
company-go backend, you'll have to change that in company-go.el.

In other words, company-go.el does this:

(add-hook 'go-mode-hook (lambda ()
                          (set (make-local-variable 'company-backends) '(company-go))
                          (company-mode)))

P.S. Also, default company-mode colors looks ugly, but I haven't tweaked that
yet, probably will add a couple of notes here when I'm done with it.
